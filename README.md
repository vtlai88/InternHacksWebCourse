<h1>What I did in this series:</h1>

<p>Session 1: How to send an anonymous email from firebase to a user</p>
<p>Session 2: How to handle the callback url and make a basic form</p>
<p>Session 3: Make a NodeJS app, and finish the create user process</p>
<p>Session 4: Dockerize the backend, and host frontend (ui)</p>

<h1>Software Engineer/Collaborator on Basics to Web Course at Internhacks2020</h1>

1. 2 week apprenticeship program where I assisted a Senior Engineer in building an entire web course from the ground up.

2. Lead in security by implementing an out-of-band create user flow using both firebase auth’s anonymous sign-in and standard create user

3. Lead in innovation by creating 2 custom npm scripts to automate deployment of the frontend and backend to the Heroku and surge cloud

4. Lead in refactoring by converting an only frontend project to a frontend and backend project

5. Leveraged docker to build a custom container, ship to the Heroku docker registry, and deploy to Heroku

6. Developed multiple nodeJS APIs to handle creating the user and others prototype APIs as an educational tool for the class itself




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
